\usage{
geocode(addresses, ..., cache_name = tempdir())
}
\arguments{
\item{addresses}{a list or vector addresses}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \code{\link[mappp:mappp]{mappp::mappp()}}; set options for
cache here}

\item{cache_name}{Name or path for a custom cache directory. Defaults to
\code{tempdir()}.}
}
\value{
list of geocoding results with one address per element; some
addresses may return more than one geocoding result if there is a tie among
the best matches
}
\description{
To prevent errors and optimize accuracy, please remove non alphanumeric
characters from address strings prior to geocoding. In general, address
cleaning is outside the scope of this package and should be completed prior
to geocoding.
}
\details{
By default, geocoding results will be cached in a local folder at the path
specified by \code{cache_name}.  See help for \code{\link[mappp:mappp]{mappp::mappp()}} to change these
defaults.
